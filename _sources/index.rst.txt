.. ValidatingCLEO documentation master file, based off sphinx-quickstart.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ValidatingCLEO's Documentation!
==================================================

This repository has been made to document specific test cases of CLEO on
Levante for CLEO's second model description paper. Specifically it tests CLEO ``v0.39.7``.

To (locally) reproduce this project, simply clone the repository. You will need to setup an
environment with the dependencies installed and then run ``pre-commit install``, but other than
that everything should work out of the box and you can now run & have fun with the project...
If not, please raise an issue on the GitHub repository.

Time to get involved! Check out the :doc:`getting started page<usage/getstart>`.
