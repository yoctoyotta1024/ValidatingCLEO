Welcome to ValidatingCLEO's Documentation!
==================================================

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development
   and our documentation is a work in progress.

   This documentation is built from the latest code in the main branch of the repository.
   It does not necessarily reflect a released version, and there may be short-commings when compared
   to the on-going code development. If you have queries related to
   this or if there is anything you wish to report please please :ref:`contact us! <contact>`.

This repository has been made to document specific test cases of CLEO on
Levante for CLEO's second model description paper.

To (locally) reproduce this project, simply clone the repository. You will need to setup an
environment with the dependencies installed and then run ``pre-commit install``, but other than
that everything should work out of the box and you can now run & have fun with the project...
If not, please raise an issue on the GitHub repository.

Time to get involved! Check out the :doc:`getting started page<usage/getstart>`.
